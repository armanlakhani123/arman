        <h1>Kannauj Attar</h1>
        <h2>Best Attar Perfume Manufacturer in India</h2>
        <p>Attar Perfume is situated in Kannauj, Uttar Pradesh (India). For thousands of years, Kannauj has been the
            center of perfume manufacturing in India, and the city is famously known as the Perfume Capital of India. At
            Ittar Perfume, we are committed to providing the best and purest quality of products to our customers.</p>

        <p>We are slowly building our position in the global market. We have established ourselves as one of the leading
            and <strong>best attar perfume manufacturers in India</strong> of attars, essential oils, perfumery
            compounds, and absolute oils.</p>

        <p>Till today, our exceptional production of fragrances is carried out in the most traditional extraction form
            which is known as “Degs and Bhapka System”. The steam distillation process is a conventional way of
            extracting natural fragrance or oil from the plant. It is responsible for driving the purest characteristic
            of the odor of the plant that is chemical-free and alcohol-free.</p>

                <h2>Attar Perfume</h2>
                <p>Attars are natural and chemical-free perfumes made from natural materials like Oudh, flowers, and
                    musks whose smell is more pleasant to our senses. Due to their natural ingredients, these perfumes
                    are skin-friendly, healthy, and hygienic. Attars also have healing effects because natural ittars
                    are chemical-free, pure, and made from botanical sources. In India, the practice of extracting the
                    best Attar perfumes or perfume oils from herbs, flowers, and spices dates back more than 5000 years.

                <h2>Essential Oils</h2>
                <p>Essential oil is nature’s best-kept secret and is obtained through the<br>
                    steam distillation process of different plant materials such as flowers,<br>
                    herbs, roots, leaves, etc. These oils retain the natural smell and flavor of<br>
                    their source. Essential oils have been in use for thousands of years.<br>
                    These oils are useful in various fields such as health, spiritual, religious,<br>
                    cosmetic, and other applications. Attar Perfume has a huge collection<br>
                    of essential oils that can be used either in the form of a single essential<br>
                    oil or as a combination of essential oils depending on the experience of<br>
                    a user and the desired benefits.

                <h2>Absolute Oils</h2>
                <p>Absolute oils are highly concentrated aromatic oils primarily obtained<br>
                    from plant parts. Although they resemble essential oils, their extraction<br>
                    method (called enfleurage) is difficult and time-consuming. The<br>
                    aroma of an Absolute Oil, which is widely used in the perfumery, is<br>
                    more similar to the aroma of the original plant product than the aroma<br>
                    of Essential Oils made through distillation. Because the Absolute Oils<br>
                    are so concentrated, a little bit goes a long way. Compared to essential<br>
                    oils, absolute oils are harder to find in the market. When it comes to<br>
                    providing absolute oils, Attar Perfume is a pioneer in India.

                <h2>Floral Water</h2>
                <p> Floral water is the water that is left over after essential oils are<br>
                    extracted using steam distillation. Though its main ingredient is water,<br>
                    it also contains fine traces of essential oils and minute amounts of the<br>
                    substances, such as flowers, plants, or any other source from which the<br>
                    essential oil was derived. As floral water is naturally formed during the<br>
                    extraction of essential oils, it can be quite beneficial for your skin and<br>
                    face. Attar Perfume offers a wide range of premium quality floral water.<br>
